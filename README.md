# Final Assignment

In this project we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully or
not. Much of the savings of Spacex is because of reusing first stage. If we are
able to determine this, we will be able to predict the cost of launch, for an
alternate company.

Some of the questions that need to be answered include which launch site, orbit
has more successes? How success is impacted by payload mass, booster
version? How does flight number affect success?
